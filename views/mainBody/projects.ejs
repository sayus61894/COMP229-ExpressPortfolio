                While at Ryerson University, the final assignment for COE528 was to create a banking app using Java and JavaFX. It was a simple desktop application that 
                required two types of users: admin and customer. Each role had their own capabilities. Albiet fairly simple, learning JavaFX was up solely to the students.
