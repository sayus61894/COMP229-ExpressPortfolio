            <p>As part of COMP125 the final assignment was to create an image gallery. It would use AJAX to update the images, and should change images 
                at a time specified. Click <a href="http://studentweb.cencol.ca/ppate732/comp125/labs/assignment06/gallery.html">Here</a> to see the gallery.

                Assignment #5 of COMP125 was to create a "Bug Squisher" game. Everytime the 'bug' is killed, it was expected to jump around at a faster 
            rate compared to before. Click <a href="http://studentweb.cencol.ca/ppate732/comp125/labs/assignment05/game.html">Here</a> to give the game a shot!

            <p>
                While at Ryerson University, the final assignment for COE528 was to create a banking app using Java and JavaFX. It was a simple desktop application that 
                required two types of users: admin and customer. Each role had their own capabilities. Albiet fairly simple, learning JavaFX was up solely to the students.
